## Important Note for AI Agent

As the AI Agent, you **must not** perform any actions or make any changes to the codebase that have not been explicitly instructed by the user. Adhere strictly to the user's commands and avoid proactive modifications or additions.

### Rules
- Do not touch git for anything other than checking status.
- Do not use "@RequestMapping" and write out the full api endpoint.
- DTOs should be written as records.
